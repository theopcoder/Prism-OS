<p id="product-sans">Prism OS is a small project maintained by four developers, It is intended to become a widely used OS, the motivation behind this project is the fact most current operating systems are slow, and based off of old existing kernels, windows for example has not had a complete kernel rewrite in 20+ years.</p>
<p id="product-sans">This project is based off of the Cosmos developer kit, it uses C# as its internal coding language</p>
